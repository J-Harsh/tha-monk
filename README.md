- **tailwind-css:**
  - **Purpose:** Provides a utility-first CSS framework for rapid and consistent styling.
  - **Reasoning:** Speeds up development, facilitates custom component creation, and promotes maintainable theming. Personal preference due to rapid UI development.

**Data Management & API Interactions:**

- **@tanstack/react-query:**
  - **Purpose:** Manages server-state data fetching, caching, and updates.
  - **Reasoning:** Streamlines data fetching by handling loading, error, and pagination states. The `useInfiniteQuery` hook simplifies infinite scroll implementations, reducing boilerplate code.
- **zustand:**
  - **Purpose:** A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state-management solution.
  - **Reasoning:** Simplifies local state management, preventing prop drilling and making state updates more manageable. It's a lightweight alternative to Redux Toolkit, offering flexibility and ease of use.

**Utility & Optimization:**

- **clsx & tailwind-merge:**

- **lodash.debounce & lodash.throttle:**
  - **Purpose:** Control the frequency of function execution, particularly within modal interactions.
  - **Reasoning:** Improves performance by preventing excessive function calls, especially during user input or rapid events. While these functions could be implemented manually, using Lodash provides a reliable and efficient solution.

**Build Tooling:**

- **vite:**
  - **Purpose:** A fast and modern build tool for React applications.
  - **Reasoning:** Offers rapid development with hot module replacement and efficient bundling. It's recommended by the React documentation, ensuring compatibility and future-proofing.
